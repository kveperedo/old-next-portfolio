## Portfolio

Hello! I am Kevin Von Erich Peredo, a front-end engineer.

I made this portfolio to showcase my projects, relevant skills and abilities, and basic information needed. I also did it for fun. A mobile-first design approach was used for better user experiences both in mobile and desktop. Technologies and tools used are Next.js, React, Typescript, Framer Motion and CSS Modules.
